69896004|mild|Start a csDMARD; hydroxychloroquine preferred. Sulfasalazine over methotrexate; methotrexate over leflunomide. Avoid chronic glucocorticoids (short course, lowest dose only if needed). Reassess in 4–12 weeks (treat-to-target).
69896004|mild to moderate|Start methotrexate for moderate activity; consider hydroxychloroquine only if close to low activity. Use treat-to-target; reassess in 4–12 weeks; escalate if not at target in 3–6 months
69896004|moderate|Start methotrexate monotherapy; titrate to ≥15 mg/week within 4–6 weeks if tolerated (optimize route/split dosing and folate). Avoid chronic glucocorticoids. If not at target on maximized methotrexate, add a bDMARD or tsDMARD rather than triple therapy (shared decision-making).
69896004|moderate to severe|Start methotrexate promptly (treat-to-target). Consider short course, lowest-dose glucocorticoids only if needed. Reassess in 4–12 weeks. If not at target on maximized methotrexate, add a bDMARD or tsDMARD rather than triple therapy.
69896004|severe|Start methotrexate promptly for high disease activity (treat-to-target) with rapid titration. Consider short course, lowest-dose glucocorticoids only if needed. Reassess in 4–12 weeks; if not at target on maximized methotrexate, add a bDMARD or tsDMARD rather than triple therapy
