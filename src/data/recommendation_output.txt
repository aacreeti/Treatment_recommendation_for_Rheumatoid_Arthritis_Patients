Recommendation: Start methotrexate monotherapy; titrate to ≥15 mg/week within 4–6 weeks if tolerated (optimize route/split dosing and folate). Avoid chronic glucocorticoids. If not at target on maximized methotrexate, add a bDMARD or tsDMARD rather than triple therapy (shared decision-making).
Reason:
Diagnosis Code: 69896004 (rheumatoid arthritis) | Severity: 6736007 (moderate)
------------------------------------------------------------
Recommendation: Start methotrexate for moderate activity; consider hydroxychloroquine only if close to low activity. Use treat-to-target; reassess in 4–12 weeks; escalate if not at target in 3–6 months
